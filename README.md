# BonusMan

This project aims to design and develop a mobile application for the management of orders for Moroccan grocers using BONUS MANS (delivery drivers) who will replace the distribution chain and act as a direct intermediary between the production factory and the grocer. This allows grocers to have quick access to products.

# The supply chain, a complex network.

# Solution

To address this issue, we propose to add BONUS MANS or delivery agents to balance the load when there is a gap in the supply chain. With this solution, grocers will no longer need to wait for the chain as they used to. Instead, they can simply browse the products, place an order, and a BONUS MAN will deliver it - that's it!

# THE APPLICATION

This work was carried out as part of our end-of-studies project, which aimed to design and develop a mobile application for the management and tracking of orders for Moroccan grocers. We have successfully created this application, which will provide the opportunity to replace the supply chain and avoid being among the victims of system breakdown.
